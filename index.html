          <p>Salaam everyone. I am currently a senior student at Northern Illinois University studying Computer Science; slated to graduate in May 2017. This summer I interned as a Java developer with The Northern Trust Company in downtown Chicago and helped them find creative ways to source and present their data.

          <p>Hello, my name is Usaid Siddiqui. I studied at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. At 18, I was not entirely sure what I wanted to study. I juggled around from major to major. My sophomore year I had decided that I was going to study Community Health with a concentration in Health Planning and Administration. I graduated this past May and I can confidently say that my time in college was the best 4 years of my life. I am currently still looking for a full position and hope to start graduate school in Fall 2017. </p>

		  <h4>Class of 2013<h4>
          <p>Hi everyone my name is David Kruse. I am currently a senior majoring in Kinesology at the University of Illinois at Chicago. People always immediately ask me what that means. Kinesology is the study of human movement and locomotion. Individuals who study this field typically go on to become doctors, therapists and researchers. I am also engaged in graduate research in the biomechanics lab where my team is working to develop new assessments of balance.I have been accepted into the Doctor of Physical Therapy degree program at Rosalind Franklin University of Medical Sciences and am awaiting word from several other schools. During my career I plan to work with individuals to regain mobility following spinal cord injury. I may also have the opportunity to work for a major league team during my career!</p>
